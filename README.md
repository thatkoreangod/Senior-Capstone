# Senior Capstone

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create 5 autonomous robots that will assume a protective formation around a leader from any given position. Unlike current examples in which a stationary third party view is required, the robots are capable of swarming into position on their own. The robots will detect their unique counterparts through a rotating ping sensor. The robots will move on a 4x4 wheel frame.
